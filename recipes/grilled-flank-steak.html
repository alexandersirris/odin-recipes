        <p>Flank steak is the cow's lower chest or abdominal muscle. Since it's muscle that's used a lot, the flank is a
            thick-grained, low-fat cut. The beauty of it is that it's inexpensive, but flavorful. It's a versatile cut
            of beef, especially when prepared well. It's best marinated and then seared whole over high heat. Cutting
            the cooked flank steak against the grain at a 45 degree angle ensures you're cutting through the tough
            parts, making it easier to eat.

            Skirt steak is a similar cut, but has a different shape, a bit more fat, and the grain runs in a different
            direction. No matter the occassion, when you're thinking of the amount of flank steak to cook don't forget
            all the left over dishes you can create.
