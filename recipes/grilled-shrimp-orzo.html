        <p>Harissa is a spicy chili paste from North Africa, a common condiment used in Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria.
            It’s made with hot chili peppers, garlic, and olive oil, and it often has roasted bell peppers, tomato
            paste, and coriander. It’s frequently served with roasted meats, seafood, vegetables, and egg dishes.
            Looking for substitutes for some of the items? Check these out:
        <ol class="ls">
            <li>Cubes of swordfish would work well as a substitute in the seafood realm. Strips of thin chicken cutlets
                threaded onto the skewers also work.</li>
            <li>Couscous would be a great swap for the orzo, but any short pasta would work. You could even use white or
                brown rice.</li>
            <li>The flavor of turmeric for the orzo can be approximated with curry powder, which often contains
                turmeric. You could use 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin for a nod to the earthy flavor though you won’t have
                the yellow hue.</li>
            <li>Large, mild green olives like Picholine or Castelvetrano are delicious, but pitted Spanish olives will
                also deliver a briny note. Use a scant cup because Spanish olives are more full-flavored and saltier.
